        <h2>2. General Information and Mandatory Disclosures</h2>
        <h3>Data Protection</h3>
        <p>The operators of this site take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We handle your personal
            data confidentially and in accordance with legal data protection regulations as well as this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that can identify you
            personally. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how
            and for what purpose this occurs.</p>
        <p>We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication via email) can have security gaps.
            Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>
        <h3>Information on the Responsible Party</h3>
        <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
        <address>
            Tom Petri
            <br />
            Wilhelmstraße 32
            <br />
            48324 Sendenhorst
            <br />
            Email: <a href="mailto:E-Mail: tom.petri7@gmail.com">tom.petri7@gmail.com</a>
        </address>
        <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, determines the
            purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

        <h3>Data Retention Period</h3>
        <p>Unless a more specific retention period is mentioned in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain
            with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate deletion request
            or withdraw consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, provided we have no other legally
            permissible reasons for retaining your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the
            latter case, deletion occurs after these reasons cease to apply.</p>

        <h3>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website</h3>
        <p>If you have given consent to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or
            Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data pursuant to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the case of
            explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing also takes place on
            the basis of Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on
            your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing also occurs on the basis of §25(1) TTDSG.
            Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required to fulfill a contract or for pre-contractual
            measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is
            necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our
            legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The applicable legal basis in each individual case is
            specified in the following sections of this privacy policy.</p>

        <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
        <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent already
            given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out up to the revocation remains unaffected
            by the revocation.</p>

        <h3>Right to Object in Certain Cases and Against Direct Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
        <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS
            ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
            PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN
            THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE CAN
            DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS
            OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART.
            21(1) GDPR).</p>
        <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE
            PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING IN CONNECTION WITH
            SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING
            PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>

        <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
        <p>In case of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
            authority, especially in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or the location of the
            alleged violation. This right to complain exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial
            remedies.</p>

        <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>You have the right to receive data that we process automatically based on your consent or to fulfill a
            contract, and to have it transmitted to yourself or a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable
            format. If you request direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done if
            technically feasible.</p>

        <h3>Right to Access, Deletion, and Correction</h3>
        <p>You have the right, within the framework of applicable legal provisions, to obtain free information about
            your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose of data processing, and if necessary, the
            right to correct or delete this data. For this and further questions on personal data, you can contact us at
            any time.</p>

        <h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any
            time for this. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this.
                During this period, you have the right to request restriction of processing.</li>
            <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request restriction instead of
                deletion.</li>
            <li>If we no longer need your personal data but you need it to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims, you
                have the right to request restriction instead of deletion.</li>
            <li>If you have objected under Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of interests must be carried out. As long as it
                is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request restriction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have restricted processing of your personal data, this data may only be processed – aside from storage
            – with your consent or to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims, to protect the rights of another natural
            or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the EU or a member state.</p>

        <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
        <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries you
            send to us as site operators, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. A secure connection is indicated by the
            browser changing from "http://" to "https://" and the lock symbol in the browser address bar.</p>
        <p>When SSL or TLS encryption is enabled, the data you transmit cannot be read by third parties.</p>

        <h3>Objection to Advertising Emails</h3>
        <p>The use of contact information published within the framework of the imprint obligation to send unsolicited
            advertising and information materials is hereby objected to. The operators of the site expressly reserve the
            right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam
            emails.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Collection on This Website</h2>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Our websites use so-called "cookies." Cookies are small data packages and do not harm your device. They are
            either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently on your device.
            Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain on your device
            until you delete them yourself or automatic deletion occurs via your browser.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, cookies from third parties may also be stored on your device when you visit our site (third-party
            cookies). These allow us or you to use certain services of the third party (e.g., cookies for processing
            payment services).</p>
        <p>Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary because certain website functions
            would not work without them (e.g., shopping cart or video display). Other cookies are used to analyze user
            behavior or display advertising.</p>
        <p>Cookies necessary for electronic communication, providing certain requested functions (e.g., shopping cart),
            or optimizing the website (e.g., measuring web traffic) are stored based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless
            another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary
            cookies for error-free and optimized provision of services. If consent for storing cookies or similar
            recognition technologies was obtained, processing is based exclusively on this consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR
            and §25(1) TTDSG); consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>You can configure your browser to be informed about cookie settings and allow cookies only in individual
            cases, exclude them in general, or automatically delete cookies when closing the browser. Deactivating
            cookies may limit website functionality.</p>
        <p>If third-party cookies or cookies for analysis purposes are used, we will inform you separately in this
            privacy policy and, if applicable, request consent.</p>

        <h3>Contact Form</h3>
        <p>If you send inquiries via the contact form, your details from the form, including the contact data provided,
            will be stored for handling the request and for follow-up questions. These data will not be shared without
            your consent.</p>
        <p>Processing is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request is related to contract fulfillment or
            pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, processing is based on our legitimate interest in effective
            handling of inquiries (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR), if obtained; consent can
            be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>The data you provide in the contact form remains with us until you request deletion, withdraw consent, or the
            purpose for storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been handled). Mandatory legal
            requirements – especially retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>

        <h3>Inquiries by Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
        <p>If you contact us via email, phone, or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name,
            request), will be stored and processed for handling your matter. These data will not be shared without your
            consent.</p>
        <p>Processing is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request is related to contract fulfillment or
            pre-contractual measures. Otherwise, it is based on our legitimate interest in handling inquiries
            effectively (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR), if obtained; consent can be revoked at
            any time.</p>
        <p>The data sent via contact requests remains with us until you request deletion, withdraw consent, or the
            purpose for storage no longer applies (e.g., after handling your matter). Mandatory legal requirements –
            especially retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>
